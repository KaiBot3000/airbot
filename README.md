# AirBot

A personal helper bot that will let me know when to open and shut the windows in my house, based on outside air quality.

## Goals
- Deploy a basic pet project for funsies
- Help me stop anxiously checking AQI and deciding whether to die of heat stroke or smoke inhalation
- Give myself something to do when it's smoky out and I'm stuck inside

## Anti-Goals
- This is not a shiny production app
- I'm not trying to support a bajillion users

## Set Up

`source venv/bin/activate`
